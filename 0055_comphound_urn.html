<h3>Lunar Eclipse, CORS Workaround, CompHound</h3>
<p>This weekend, I wanted to add an additional field to the component occurrences in
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb">CompHoundWeb database</a>,
which led me to discover and fix a trivial yet serious error in my C# client.</p>
<p>Also, let me mention a CORS workaround pointed out by my colleague
<a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com">Cyrille Fauvel</a> and my night out to watch the lunar eclipse:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Lunar Eclipse</h4>
<p>Did you notice that we had
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2015_lunar_eclipse">total lunar eclipse</a> early
Monday morning?</p>
<p>I spent Sunday night on a hill with some friends celebrating a full moon fire, and then slept out beside the embers to catch it beginning around 4:50 in the morning:</p>

</center></p>
<p>Nice experience, this 'red moon', well worth while braving the cold.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Fed up with CORS?</h4>
<p>Here is a way to quickly and easily temporarily work around a CORS issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> is
a browser security measure that prevents you from running AJAX JavaScript code coming from different places and letting it interact together.</p>
<p>If such a situation arises and your server does not specifically authorize other domains via <code>* = all</code> or some other domain description method, you'll get a CORS issue.</p>
<p>Note that CORS, or cross-origin resource sharing, has to be enabled on the server side, whereas the security check happens on the client side. The Autodesk Apigee server is using ‘Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *', so you should not get a problem, but it may happen still depending of the other domains or technology you're using.</p>
<p>Now and again a CORS issue might come up that requires time and research to fix, just when you are in a real hurry to get something else done and finished, e.g. for a Hackathon presentation.</p>
<p>In that case,
the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * Chrome plugin</a> may
come in handy.</p>
<p>It is not a universal answer to this problem, but might enable a good quick workaround if you‘re in a rush.</p>
<p>Instead of spending hours (or days) to find out what is causing a CORS issue, you can install this little extension which intercepts the server response and adds the ‘Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *' to the response header, telling your browser that all is fine.
Then you can work on fixing the real underlying CORS cause later.</p>
<p>It is also useful if you have a piece of software that causes problems on a local server, but would work fine when you're online, e.g., swagger-ui from swagger.io.</p>
<p>Thank you, Cyrille, for pointing it out.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>CompHound Updates</h4>
<p>I added a field to
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound">CompHound</a> database
to equip each component instance with a URN to identify the
translated <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/">View and Data API</a> model hosting it.</p>
<p>I thought that would be really quick and easy.</p>
<p>So it would have been, if
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt">CompHound C# .NET Revit add-in</a> had
not been harbouring a pernicious little bug of my making.</p>
<p>Luckily, I deleted the mongolab database and started to rebuild it from scratch, which uncovered the flaw in
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt/blob/master/CompHoundRvt/InstanceData.cs">InstanceData</a> implementation class.</p>
<p>I added the new urn field to the C# client and the node.js server, deleted the mongolab database, redeployed the server to heroku and reran CompHoundRvt in <code>rst_advanced_sample_project.rvt</code>.</p>
<p>When the Revit add-in was run, all data appeared to be transferred properly, yet nothing appeared in the database.</p>
<p>I suspected an error in the <code>upsert</code> function, since I had already had issues with that in the past.</p>
<p>I reimplemented a new version of it after looking more deeply at the
<a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update">mongo update documentation</a>
followed by
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7267102/how-do-i-update-upsert-a-document-in-mongoose">how to update/upsert a document in Mongoose?</a></p>
<p>The new <code>update4</code> method uses the mongoose <code>findOneAndUpdate</code> function:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  update4 : function(req, res) {
    var id = req.params.id;
    console.log('Updating ' + id);
    //console.log(req.body);
    Instance.findOneAndUpdate({"_id":id}, req.body,
      {upsert:true/*,new:true*/},
      function (err, doc) {
        if (err) return console.log(err);
        //console.log(doc);
        return res.sendStatus(202);
    });
  },
</pre>

<p>Still no data was being passed in, and the component instance documents only listed their <code>_id</code> and <code>__v</code> fields.</p>
<p>I read about Matt Schrager's <a href="http://matthewschrager.com/2013/02/19/restsharp-post-body">RestSharp POST body problems</a> and temporarily replaced <code>request.AddBody</code> by <code>request.AddObject</code>, but that did not help either.</p>
<p>Finally I logged the output of serialising the InstanceData to JSON and discovered that the result was empty right there at the beginning, in the C# client uploading it to the database via REST.</p>
<p>My InstanceData class was not exposing any public properties to serialise, so it never worked.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud">FireRatingCloud</a> sample that I based it on did it properly, though, so that works fine.</p>
<p>When I tested it last time, the database was already completely populated beforehand, so I never noticed that no new data was being passed in.</p>
<p>Every time I tested it in the past, it was just updating existing records with no changes.</p>
<p>Well, it is all fixed in the
current <a href="https://github.com/CompHound">CompHound</a> implementation,
in <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.19">CompHoundWeb 0.0.19</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt/releases/tag/2016.0.0.4">CompHoundRvt 2016.0.0.4</a>.</p>
<p>All the links
to <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHound.github.io#try-it-out-live">Try it out Live</a> have
been appropriately updated to the new web server and mongolab database instances.</p>
