Stephen Preston has left you a comment:

Its a good job the viewer supports color, Jeremy. Otherwise, you might have had to reference '50 shades of grey' :-D.

Dear Stephen,

Yes, lucky me  :-)

Thank you for your comment, by the way... you are number two so far on this blog.

Cheers, Jeremy

Hi Jeremy. It looks like you are building all this locally on your computer. Would there be any way of doing this online so we could actually see a demo or just look at some output?

jeremy tammik asnwered Theo

Dear Theo,

Yes, absolutely!

Thank you for asking.

This is definitely in the works.

I absolutely want to share this for all to see and test.

I also absolutely want to make sure it works, which normally includes finding and fixing a bug or two, before asking you to suffer through it as well.

Therefore, I am now working on the .NET C# desktop add-in, will test that locally, then post the whole thing on the web, e.g., Heroku, just like I did with the last project, from where you can run it live remotely.

It should only be a matter of a few days more until I get to that stage.

Meanwhile, to see a demo live right now, you could fork the GitHub repository, clone to your local machine, and run it locally yourself as well.

Cheers, Jeremy.

Theo --> jeremy tammik

Hi Jeremy

Yes, I know I could fork the GitHub repo but I end up almost never doing that. ;-(

Here's the thing: what I have liked in a lot of your previous posts is that at the end of the post I can click and something happens. This turns the post into some kind or experience event and makes people happy that they read the post.

Of course this is not always possible, but the more you include features like this the more attractive the work becomes.

Theo

Dear Theo,

Thank you very much for letting me know and confirming that.

I am the same :-)

I'll try to provide that for this sample as well real soon now!

Cheers, Jeremy.

I see a very good idea using mongodb and revit! I've been playing with mongodb and revit trying to simplify the way revit segments data and package the data as a document packet. Good Stuff!!

Dear David,

Great, very glad you like it.

Thank you for your appreciation!

I am totally enthusiastic too.

Looking forward to hearing more about what you come up with.

Cheers, Jeremy.

Welcome to the world of Markdown - as used by GitHub, StackOverflow, Reddit and in many more sites.

BTW, I use https://github.com/showdownjs/... to convert Markdown to HTML in all my JavaScript apps.

Dear Theo,

Wow, great, thank you for the useful pointer!

That fits exactly what I was thinking of looking into next.

If each page generates its own HTML from the embedded MD, there is no need more for an external conversion step.

Cheers, Jeremy.

Hi Jeremy

You are getting it!

Here's a demo showing how I use Showdown on GitHub to do several fun things:

Showdown demo for Jeremy:

Theo

Dear Theo,

Brilliant, thank you for the wonderful sample!

That fits exactly what I was thinking of, once again.

Very useful!

I went right ahead and promoted it to a main blog post:

http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/js-embedded-markdown-using-showdown.html

Now I can supply all my non-savvy friends with web sites that they can easily edit themselves :-)

Cheers, Jeremy.

yellowstone

Hi Jeremy. What are the requirements to get all this working (database, .NET framework, etc.). How do I use it with SQL server ?

2:24 p.m., Monday Aug. 24

jeremy tammik Mod  yellowstone

Dear Yellowstone,

The part discussed above has no database or .NET requirements at all, nor does it have anything whatsoever to do with SQL server.

For a full description of the entire project, how to start, what to install and where it leads to in the end, please refer to the two FireRating GitHub projects, one for the Revit add-in on the desktop, the other for the cloud-based mongo database:

Cheers, Jeremy.
