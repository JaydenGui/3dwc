Stephen Preston has left you a comment:

Its a good job the viewer supports color, Jeremy. Otherwise, you might have had to reference '50 shades of grey' :-D.

Dear Stephen,

Yes, lucky me  :-)

Thank you for your comment, by the way... you are number two so far on this blog.

Cheers, Jeremy

Hi Jeremy. It looks like you are building all this locally on your computer. Would there be any way of doing this online so we could actually see a demo or just look at some output?

jeremy tammik asnwered Theo

Dear Theo,

Yes, absolutely!

Thank you for asking.

This is definitely in the works.

I absolutely want to share this for all to see and test.

I also absolutely want to make sure it works, which normally includes finding and fixing a bug or two, before asking you to suffer through it as well.

Therefore, I am now working on the .NET C# desktop add-in, will test that locally, then post the whole thing on the web, e.g., Heroku, just like I did with the last project, from where you can run it live remotely.

It should only be a matter of a few days more until I get to that stage.

Meanwhile, to see a demo live right now, you could fork the GitHub repository, clone to your local machine, and run it locally yourself as well.

Cheers, Jeremy.

Hi Jeremy

Yes, I know I could fork the GitHub repo but I end up almost never doing that. ;-(

Here's the thing: what I have liked in a lot of your previous posts is that at the end of the post I can click and something happens. This turns the post into some kind or experience event and makes people happy that they read the post.

Of course this is not always possible, but the more you include features like this the more attractive the work becomes.

Dear Theo,

Thank you very much for letting me know and confirming that.

I am the same :-)

I'll try to provide that for this sample as well real soon now!

Cheers, Jeremy.
