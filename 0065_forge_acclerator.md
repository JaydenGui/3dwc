Autodesk Forge Accelerator #3dwebcoder #revitapi #3dweb #a360 #3dwebaccel #webgl @adskForge

Happy New Year! I had a really good break, although I spent the last ten days being ill and coming to grips with a serious sinusitis. I am getting better again now, though. I also learned the nice card game Tichu :-)  Meanwhile, Autodesk announced the Forge platform at Autodesk University in the beginning of December to power a connected ecosystem for product development, inviting developers and innovators to join in to integrate design, engineering, and manufacturing and build the future of making things together...

### Happy New Autodesk Forge Accelerator!

<p style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold">Happy New Year!</p>

I had a really good break, although I spent the last ten days being ill and coming to grips with a
serious [sinusitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis).

I am getting better again now, though.

I also learned the nice card game [Tichu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu) &nbsp; :-)

Anyway, back at work again, looking at Revit cases and hungering for my next web-based project, coming up real soon now...

Meanwhile, Autodesk announced the [Forge](http://forge.autodesk.com) platform at Autodesk University in the beginning of December to power a connected ecosystem for product development, inviting developers and innovators to join in to integrate design, engineering, and manufacturing and build the future of making things together.

Now the date has been set for the first Autodesk Forge Accelerator &ndash; formerly known as
the [Autodesk Cloud Accelerator](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com).

The Forge Accelerator will be held in the Autodesk San Francisco office from March 14th to 18th inclusive. If your application is successful, you will be invited to spend the week in our office working on your own projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs, with direct interactive help from the ADN DevTech team and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View & Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs.

To apply for this program, please submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you'd like to work on and how it will make use of the Autodesk Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available
at [autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply). Note that that page has not yet been updated to include this latest event &ndash; that's how 'hot off the press' this announcement is &nbsp; :-)

If your application is successful, we will provide you with accommodation at an Autodesk designated hotel. All other travel and living costs are at your own expense.

The deadline for submitting proposals is January 31st 2016. We are looking forward to receiving your application. Good luck!
