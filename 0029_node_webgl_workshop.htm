<h3>Vrok It, WebGL Workshop and Cloud Accelerator</h3>

<p>Back from a very relaxing workshop in the beautiful Swiss Emmental region, I am now faced with various interesting news items and tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Vrok It using collaborative VR!</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">WebGL workshop report &ndash; day one</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">EMEA Autodesk cloud accelerator extension</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Vrok It Using Collaborative VR!</h4>

<p>Would you like to have a quick play around with collaborative stereoscopic 3D VR using the simple, fun, and affordable <a href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard">Google cardboard</a>?</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://vrok.it" style="font-size: larger">vrok.it</a>!</p>

<p>'Vrok' is a combination of 'Virtual Reality Online Collaboration' and the verb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">to grok</a>.
Vrok-it enables multiple people to grok a 3D model in a way that simply wasnâ€™t possible before.
<a href="http://vrok.it">Read all about it and try it out live</a>.</p>

<h4>WebGL Workshop Report &ndash; Day One</h4>

<p>I received a quick report from day one of the
<a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/web-fest-hackathons-au-and-webgl-workshops.html#6">
free and open Milano WebGL workshop</a> on
Saturday, June 6th: it went well, over expectations, with about 30 participants, no-show rate &lt; 10%, great interest and involvement, cf. the
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wemake_cc/sets/72157653987455898">Flickr photo album</a>.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to hearing more about the next meetings and preparing for my participation on June 27<sup>th</sup> and presenting on the
implementation of a node.js based REST API, the
<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">Autodesk View and Data API</a>, and its WebGL viewer.</p>

<h4>EMEA Autodesk Cloud Accelerator Extension</h4>

<p>Following up on the success of the first two <a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/webgl-viewer-cloud-accelerator-verold-and-rtc.html#2">cloud accelerator classes held in the US</a>, we are delighted to announce our first one-week intensive program taking place in Europe, in Prague, Czech Republic, September 13-18, 2015, to be held at the Autodesk Prague office.</p>

<p>The Cloud Accelerator is a chance for you to work intensively on your chosen project with the help, support and training of the Autodesk Cloud Engineering teams. If you have a project that can make good use of any Autodesk cloud technology API &ndash; View and Data, Autodesk BIM 360, AutoCAD I/O, Autodesk InfraWorks 360 or Autodesk ReCap &ndash; this is a great opportunity to accelerate your development with face-to-face advice and support from Autodesk cloud technology experts.</p>

<p>A said, this is a one-week intensive program, designed to accommodate the needs of software companies where two full weeks out of the office to attend an Accelerator workshop would be too much of a burden.</p>

<p>To learn more about the benefits of this program, hear first-hand from some of the participants in the first event &ndash; a two-week accelerator in San Francisco &ndash; on how they benefited by attending, <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/participantsmarch2015">watch the videos.</a></p>

<p>For more information and to apply, visit <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/prague">autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/prague</a>.</p>

<p>I look forward to being there as well and would love to meet and work with you!</p>

<p>Good luck with your application!</p>
