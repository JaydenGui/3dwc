<h3>CompHound Heroku Deployment, Urban Farming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I discussed the
<a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/the-comphound-mongoose-datatable.html">CompHound datatable implementation</a> and
thought I would be able to deploy to Heroku for you to try it out right away.</p>
<p>That took a moment longer than expected due to one little hiccup.</p>
<p>Here are my steps towards discovering and resolving it, and a few other topics that also arose in the meantime:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Cloud9</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Online slide deck and easy github.io domain rerouting</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">CompHound deployment to Heroku</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Heroku requires HTTPS</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Recent CompHound commits</a></li>
<li><a href="#7">Try it out live</a></li>
<li><a href="#8">CompHound road map</a></li>
<li><a href="#9">Self-sufficient urban farming on 1/10 of an acre</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Cloud9</h4>
<p>Are you aware of <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/philippe-leefsma.html">Philippe Leefsma</a> created a boilerplate sample for using the
<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">View and Data API</a>.</p>
<p>Based on that, you can have your viewer-based web application up and running within minutes.</p>
<p>Philippe guides us through the required steps in full detail in his
<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2015/09/first-try-at-cloud9-viewdata-api-boilerplate.html">first try at Cloud9, View &amp; Data API boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more general information, the tutorial on
<a href="http://charless.org/?p=283">Github, Cloud9, NodeJS &amp; Heroku: develop &amp; deploy a web(socket) application</a> and
the Cloud9 document on
<a href="https://docs.c9.io/docs/deploying-via-cli">deploying via the command line</a> might
fit the bill.</p>
<p>So cool.</p>
<p>Let alone the fact that Cloud9 sports one of the shortest URLs I know, <a href="https://c9.io">c9.io</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Online Slide Deck and Easy GitHub.io Domain Rerouting</h4>
<p>Last week, I explored how to
<a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/c-doordata-and-nodejs-doorservice-classes.html#2">set up a Google domain and reroute it to display a github.io web page</a>.</p>
<p>This week,
<a href="http://www.shiyaluo.com">Shiya Luo</a> gave a presentation on the
<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">View and Data API</a> to
the
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaJavaScript/events/225042453">Monday night Atlanta JS meetup group</a>.</p>
<p>She created a really nice online slide deck for that, very much to the point, accessible from
<a href="http://www.shiyaluo.com/atl-js">shiyaluo.com/atl-js</a>, using
<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js">reveal.js</a>.</p>
<p>I congratulated her on the super slides, cool hosting on her own domain, and enthusiastic feedback from participants on the
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaJavaScript/events/225042453">meetup site</a>.</p>
<p>Here is her explanation how this rerouting was achieved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, what I did is I routed <code>shiya.github.io</code>â€™s <code>CNAME</code> to my own domain <code>shiyaluo.com</code>.
Every page (a repo with a branch called <code>gh-pages</code> and an <code>index.html</code>) I create on Github automatically becomes <code>shiyaluo.com/reponame</code>.
The original repo to my slides is <a href="https://github.com/shiya/atl-js">github.com/shiya/atl-js</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds easier than Kean's and my approach fiddling around with the Google domain settings.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>CompHound Deployment to Heroku</h4>
<p>I am really getting the hang of this <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">Heroku</a> deployment thing.</p>
<p>While I was writing yesterday's post, I thought it might be nice to show you what I am up to, live.</p>
<p>In other words, I wanted to deploy the CompHoundWeb server in the wide wild web and not just locally for only me to enjoy.</p>
<p>Since it already lives in its own cosy little
<a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb">CompHoundWeb GitHub repository</a>,
nothing is easier than that.</p>
<p>I created a new Heroku app for it, connected it to the GitHub repo, deployed, and had it up and running within minutes.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>There is a reason why I did not add this note right away to yesterday's post:</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Heroku Requires HTTPS</h4>
<p>I hit one little snag that took me a while to sort out:</p>
<p>The datatable view only displayed the table header and footer. All the content was missing.</p>
<p>Some exploration revealed the problem: the datatable CSS and JavaScript files were failing to load.</p>
<p>On my local machine, running locally, using <code>localhost</code>, the app is accessed via HTTP.</p>
<p>On Heroku, all access is HTTPS.</p>
<p>On Heroku, it therefore refused to access the unsafe datatable CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
<p>They were being pulled in like this by <code>views/index.jade</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
link(rel='stylesheet', href='http://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.5/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css')
script(type='text/javascript', src='http://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.5/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js')
</pre>

<p>Once I discovered that and added the missing <code>s</code>, all was fine:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
link(rel='stylesheet', href='https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.5/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css')
script(type='text/javascript', src='https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.5/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js')
</pre>

<p>The web server is up and running now; see <a href="#7">below</a> for some links to test it.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>Recent CompHound Commits</h4>
<p>Just for my own reference, here is the list of commits I made during the exploration described above:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.7">0.0.7</a> implemented config.json server configuration</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.8">0.0.8</a> improved config.json server configuration</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.9">0.0.9</a> check db connection before launching web server</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.10">0.0.10</a> mongoose datatable is up and running</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.11">0.0.11</a> cleanup and smaller datatable font size</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="7"></a>Try it out Live</h4>
<p>Now that the CompHound web server is happily deployed on Heroku, you can explore it up and running live.</p>
<p>Here is the mongolab-hosted database that we are using:
<a href="https://mongolab.com/databases/comphound">mongolab.com/databases/comphound</a>.</p>
<p>It contains the collection of
<a href="https://mongolab.com/databases/comphound/collections/instances">component instances</a>.
The only occurrences that I exported so far are from the standard Revit sample file <code>rst_advanced_sample_project.rvt</code>.
You can add more yourself by running the
<a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt">CompHoundRvt</a> add-in in any other Revit BIM of your choice.</p>
<p>The node.js web server driving the database via mongoose is hosted on
<a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, and its URL is
<a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com">https://comphound.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>
<p>Its REST API is accessible via the route <a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/api/v1">/api/v1</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/api/v1/instances">/api/v1/instances</a> should in theory returning all database entries, but it will fail with an application error due to too large data.</p>
<p>However, you can use <a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/api/v1/instances/48891eaa-9041-405b-a10f-f06585de3cbb-0001de6d">/api/v1/instances/:id</a> to retrieve the JSON document for a single specific entry.</p>
<p>Finally, it sports the beginnings of a user interface that currently provides the following access points:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com">/</a> &ndash; say hello.</li>
<li><a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/hello/jeremy">/hello/:message</a> &ndash; reply with the message passed in.</li>
<li><a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/html/count">/html/count</a> &ndash; return the number of database entries.</li>
<li><a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/www/instances1">/www/instances1</a> &ndash;  list all the database entries in a table &ndash; this can take a long time.</li>
<li><a href="https://comphound.herokuapp.com/www/datatable">/www/datatable</a> &ndash; display a datatable navigation interface through the instance records.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long run, most of these access points can be shut down again.</p>
<p>Instead, one single main <code>index</code> entry point will display the datatable listing the component occurrences as well as provide access to the still missing reporting, viewing and model navigation functionality.</p>
<h4><a name="8"></a>CompHound Road Map</h4>
<p>Here are some of the things to work on next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">View and Data API</a> viewing component.</li>
<li>Implement the model translation for the viewer.</li>
<li>Add a database column for the viewer URN.</li>
<li>Add the rest of the database columns to the datatable view.</li>
<li>Implement isolated viewing of an individual selected instance.</li>
<li>Reroute the <a href="http://comphound.net">comphound.net</a> domain to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The versions discussed above are
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.15">CompHoundWeb 0.0.15</a> node.js
mongodb web server,
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt/releases/tag/2016.0.0.2">CompHoundRvt 2016.0.0.2</a> C#
REST API client populating it, and the (placeholder) landing
page <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHound.github.io/releases/tag/0.0.1">CompHound.github.io 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="9"></a>Self-sufficient Urban Farming on 1/10 of an Acre</h4>
<p>Would you like to change the world?</p>
<p>Do you think you can make anyone else change anything at all?</p>
<p>Do you think you can change anything just for yourself, all on your own?</p>
<p>A one-woman or one-man revolution?</p>
<p>Well, here is a pretty uplifting <a href="https://youtu.be/7IbODJiEM5A">15-minute documentary</a> about someone who has done just that successfully for over a decade:</p>

</center></p>
<p><em>Surrounded by urban sprawl and just a short distance from a freeway, the <a href="http://urbanhomestead.org">Urban Homestead</a> project is a family operated and highly productive city farm. It is also a successful, real-life working model for sustainable agriculture and eco living in urban areas...
harvesting 3 tons of organic food annually from our 1/10 acre garden while incorporating many back-to-basics practices, solar energy and biodiesel in order to reduce our footprint on the earthâ€™s resources...</em></p>
