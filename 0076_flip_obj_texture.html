Flipping OBJ Axes and OBJ Texture for Forge #3dwebcoder #revitapi @AutodeskForge #ForgeDevCon

The Forge DevCon finished.
I had a full body 3D scan created in the Shapify Booth there.
The resulting OBJ model can be downloaded for $10 from shapify.me.
It includes the material and texture files.
Unfortunately, the initial model is lying down, not standing up:

<h3>Flipping OBJ Axes and OBJ Texture for Forge</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference">Forge DevCon</a> finished, and I spent a nice weekend walking around San Francisco.</p>
<p>Saturday, I crossed the Golden Gate bridge and the Marin headlands to Sausalito:</p>

<p>Sunday, I participated in
the <a href="http://ecstaticdance.org/SF">ecstatic dance event</a>
(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/EcstaticSF">FB</a>) in their great new location and enjoyed the views from
the <a href="http://sfrecpark.org/destination/buena-vista-park">Buena Vista</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidio_Park">Presidio</a> parks:</p>

<p>At the Forge DevCon, I had
a <a href="https://www.artec3d.com/events/autodesk-forge-devcon-2016">full body 3D scan</a> created in
the <a href="https://www.artec3d.com/hardware/shapifybooth">Shapify Booth</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting OBJ model can be downloaded for $10 from <a href="https://shapify.me">shapify.me</a>.</p>
<p>It includes the material and texture files. The material is initially set to very shiny, to match the plastic figurine that you can have printed out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the initial model is lying down, not standing up:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/jeremy_tammik_3d_lying_down.png" alt="Jeremy lying down" width="450">
</center></p>
<p>Lying down, it is kind of hard to manipulate in a meaningful fashion.</p>
<p>I uploaded that initial model to both
the <a href="http://trial.dotdotty.com/#/viewer?id=576449c558680a96580fa228">Dotty trial</a>
and <a href="http://a360.co/28MmpuN">A360</a> platforms
for you to test the rotation behaviour in that orientation.</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Flipping the OBJ Axes using <code>sed</code></h4>
<p>Happily, it is easy to change the axis definitions in the OBJ file using a simple <code>sed</code> operation.</p>
<p>I case you are not familiar with it, <code>sed</code> is the age-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">stream editor</a> Unix text processing utility, developed at Bell labs in 1973-1974.</p>
<p>It is available for just about any operating system, and already built in to every Unix, Linux or Mac OS shell.</p>
<p>You can easily install <code>sed</code> on other operating systems, including Windows.</p>
<p>Now, how can <code>sed</code> help us flip the figure to stand up?</p>
<p>To flip the figure from lying to standing, we need to modify two of the three cardinal axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X</code> &ndash; leave unchanged</li>
<li><code>Y</code> &ndash; replace by the <code>Z</code> value</li>
<li><code>Z</code> &ndash; replace by the <code>-Y</code> value</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, the negation is required to conserve the 'handedness' of the surface triangles.</p>
<p>The rendering system assumes them to be oriented in a specified direction, based on a right-handed coordinate system.</p>
<p>Not flipping the sign would convert the right-handed system to a left-handed one, invert the triangle orientation, and corrupt the rendering.</p>
<p>In the OBJ file, each vertex is defined in a line of text like these:</p>
<pre>
v -87.852317810058594 -89.117828369140625 25.285612106323242
v 166.26298522949219 197.78297424316406 1084.01806640625
v -29.722711563110352 307.6329345703125 1215.2177734375
</pre>

<p>The transformation required is achieved by the following <code>sed</code> script:</p>
<pre>
s/^v \([0-9\.\-]*\) \([0-9\.\-]*\) \([0-9\.\-]*\)/v \1 \3 -\2/
</pre>

<p>In clear text, it says the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>s</code> stands for 'substitute'</li>
<li><code>s/A/B/</code> means 'search for the expression <code>A</code> and replace it by <code>B</code>'</li>
<li><code>^v</code> means 'find a <code>v</code> at the beginning of the line followed by a space'</li>
<li>That is followed by the first regular number, delimited by <code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code>, representing the <code>X</code> coordinate</li>
<li>The expression consists of as many characters as possible from the set <code>0-9</code>, dot <code>.</code> and minus <code>-</code></li>
<li>That is followed by another space, followed by the second expression capturing the <code>Y</code> coordinate</li>
<li>Ditto for <code>Z</code></li>
<li>Every time a search expression matching the specified pattern is encountered, it is replaced by <code>v \1 \3 -\2</code>, i.e., the original <code>v</code> character, the <code>X</code> value, the <code>Z</code> value, and the <code>Y</code> value with a prepended minus</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the original <code>Y</code> value may be negative, and the replacement expression prepends another minus character to it, we may end up with two minus characters in front of the <code>Z</code> value.</p>
<p>Another simple substitution statement clears that up:</p>
<pre>
s/ --/ /
</pre>

<p>Meaning, 'replace space-minus-minus by just a space'.</p>
<p>I stored these two lines in a file <code>obj_flip_axes.sed</code>:</p>
<pre>
s/^v \([0-9\.\-]*\) \([0-9\.\-]*\) \([0-9\.\-]*\)/v \1 \3 -\2/
s/ --/ /g
</pre>

<p>The original OBJ file can be transformed to create a new one with flipped axes by running <code>sed</code> from the command line like this:</p>
<pre>
$ sed -f obj_flip_axes.sed model__0.obj
</pre>

<p>The result is printed to the command line.</p>
<p>The output can be directed to a new OBJ file like this:</p>
<pre>
$ sed -f obj_flip_axes.sed model__0.obj &gt; model_flipped.obj
</pre>

<p>In my case, the OBJ file size exceeds 57 MB, and this operation takes less than a second, so it is pretty efficient.</p>
<p>The resulting model is correctly oriented:</p>

<p>The interactive behaviour now is much better.</p>
<p>You can try this out for yourself as well.</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>Uploading OBJ with Material and Textures to Forge</h4>
<p>This more or less answers the question
on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37912099/how-to-upload-obj-with-mtl-and-textures-to-bucket/37929809#37929809">how to upload OBJ with MTL and textures to bucket</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> As the title suggests, how do I upload the obj model's material file and textures, as they are hard coded in the obj file?</p>
<p>Can I upload the zipped dir structure or multiple files that are in correct relation (because of the hard coded nature of obj)?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A ZIP file should work for Autodesk Model Derivative as long as the same works locally (meaning all references are working).</p>
<p>For the sample above, I simply uploaded a single zip file containing OBJ, MTL and PNG to the Dotty trial site.</p>
<p>The upload to A360 was performed by uploading the parent folder and specifying the OBJ file as the main model.</p>
