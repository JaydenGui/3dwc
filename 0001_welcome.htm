<h3>Welcome to The 3D Web Coder!</h3>

<p>The topics covered here are all things related to handling model and design data in the web.</p>

<p>My name is Jeremy Tammik.
I work in the Autodesk DevTech team, providing developer support and technical services all Autodesk API users. This includes programming support, consulting, training, conferences and evangelism.</p>

<p>For the past years, I have been focussing mainly on the Revit API making use of .NET and C# on the desktop, and sharing those experiences via <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com">The Building Coder</a> blog and the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a>.</p>

<p>Now that Autodesk is getting more and more involved in cloud and mobile related stuff, I will be sharing technical information and my own learning experiences in that realm here.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions for interesting topics you would like to see me cover in this blog, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jeremy.tammik@autodesk.com">jeremy.tammik@autodesk.com</a>. Neither my blog nor my email account should be considered channels for receiving support, however, and I make no guarantees that we will be able to address topics that are proposed. But please do feel free to drop me a line. </p>
