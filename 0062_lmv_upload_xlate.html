<h3>RTC Report LMV Model Upload and Translation</h3>
<p>I presented
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound">CompHound</a> component tracker project as work in progress at
the Revit Technology Conference <a href="http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2015eu">RTC Europe</a> in
Budapest last week.</p>

<li><a href="#4">Current CompHound Versions and To Do</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, autumn is well advanced:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>RTC Conference and Connecting Desktop to Cloud</h4>
<p>Here is an overview of the RTC conference and the three sessions I gave there:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/10/rtc-classes-and-getting-started-with-revit-macros.html">RTC Classes and Getting Started with Revit Macros</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/11/rtc-budapest-and-the-revit-api-panel.html">RTC, Budapest and the Revit API Panel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/11/connecting-desktop-and-cloud-room-editor-update.html">Connecting Desktop and Cloud, Room Editor Update</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The really interesting one for us here is the last, on connecting the desktop with the cloud.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Driving the View and Data API Upload and Translation from a C# Add-In</h4>
<p>In the meantime, my
colleague <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/adam-nagy.html">Adam Nagy</a> implemented
automatic LMV model upload and translation functionality for
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundInv">CompHoundInv</a> Inventor
C# add-in to populate the CompHound web database.</p>
<p>I integrated Adam's uploaded into the Revit
add-in <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt">CompHoundRvt</a> as well,
in <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt/releases/tag/2016.0.0.6">release 2016.0.0.6</a>.</p>
<p>Now, whenever the component occurrence data of a Revit or Inventor model is uploaded to the web database, the model itself is automatically uploaded and translated for viewing in
the <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">View and Data API</a> viewer at the same time.</p>
<p>We are talking about improving the upload and translation source code, since it is currently asynchronous.</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/philippe-leefsma.html">Philippe Leefsma</a> implemented
an asynchronous uploader in
his <a href="https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/library-dotnet-view.and.data.api">Rest API wrapper library for .NET applications</a>,
but that does not yet handle complex models with different component files referencing each other, as is common in Revit and Inventor.</p>
<p>We plan to merge these two streams in future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the uploading works and the translated model URN is added to each component instance data:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/lmv_urn.png" alt="LMV URN" width="400"/>
</center></p>
<p>The next step I want to look at is to isolate each component occurrence in the LMV model view when it is selected in the web database.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Current CompHound Versions and To Do</h4>
<p>All the project source code is available from
the <a href="https://github.com/CompHound">CompHound</a> organisation GitHub repositories.
The current versions discussed above are the web
server <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundWeb/releases/tag/0.0.39">CompHoundWeb 0.0.39</a> and
the C# REST API
clients <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundRvt/releases/tag/2016.0.0.6">CompHoundRvt 2016.0.0.6</a> for Revit
and <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHoundInv/releases/tag/2016.0.0.1">CompHoundInv 2016.0.0.1</a> for Inventor.</p>
<p>The web server is freshly redeployed to Heroku, driving the mongo database hosted on mongolab.
As always, the links
to <a href="https://github.com/CompHound/CompHound.github.io#try-it-out-live">try it out Live</a> are
up and running, so feel free to play around with it to your heart's content.</p>
<p>Here is the updated to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the asynchronous C# upload and translation library.</li>
<li>Implement isolated viewing of an individual selected instance.</li>
<li>Enable editing of some component occurrence properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to complete some of these before submitting my Autodesk University handout material due this Friday, and before presenting the project at AU in Las Vegas in December.</p>
