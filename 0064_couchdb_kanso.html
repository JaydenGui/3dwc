<h3>Roomedit CouchDB Update</h3>
<p>You may be aware of
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit">roomedit CouchDB app</a> that I implemented for
my <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp">2D real-time round-trip cloud-based RoomEditorApp</a>.</p>
<p>Originally implemented in 2013, I migrated it to Revit 2016 for my class
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/11/connecting-desktop-and-cloud-room-editor-update.html">connecting desktop and cloud</a> at
the Revit Technology Conference RTC Europe, and created a recording of
it <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/11/connecting-desktop-and-cloud-at-au-and-devdays.html">preparing to set up the AEC booth</a> at
Autodesk University.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/jaime-rosales.html">Jaime Rosales Duque</a> had some issues setting up roomedit on his machine, I struggled with the same, and
finally <a href="https://twitter.com/DanTartaglia66">@DanTartaglia66</a> joined the club, as you can see from our discussion in
a <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/11/connecting-desktop-and-cloud-at-au-and-devdays.html#comment-2389427045">series of blog post comments</a>.</p>
<p>The gist of all our discussions is that we were unable to find an easy way to upload the roomedit database definition files to CouchDB.</p>
<p>We tried <a href="https://github.com/kanso/kanso">kanso</a> in various <a href="http://kan.so">flavours</a>, both on Windows and cygwin, replicating via IrisCouch, installing <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/erica">Erica</a>, which requires <a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a>, which is built into CouchDB anyway, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>If you are really interested in the various convoluted details of these failed attempts, you can follow some of our them by studying our <a href="files/couchdb_manso_erica.pdf">email thread</a> including lots of screen snapshots.</p>
<p>In the end, we followed the simplest possible advice given
on <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/How_to_make_filesystem_backups">how to make file system backups</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of variable data files to backup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database files</li>
<li>Configuration files</li>
<li>Log files</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, you can copy a live database file from the OS at anytime without problem. Doesn't matter if its being updated, or
even if its being compacted, the CouchDB never-overwrite storage format ensures it should just work without issue.</p>
<p>For all platforms, locate your database, configuration, and log files and perform a file system copy. Be careful to preserve file permissions, too. Archive these files to wherever you want &ndash; ideally on a different machine in a different physical location &ndash; with appropriate security limiting access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I followed that advice and simply transferred the copy of my hard disk CouchDB database definition files
from <code>Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\CouchDB\var\lib\couchdb</code> to
the destination machine.</p>
<p>This solved the problem for Dan as well, and he suggested I share them with you too, so here they are, included below.</p>
<p>This is a summary of our conversation about this:</p>
<p>Dan: I cannot seem to get the Room Editor to display. I installed both the RoomEditorApp and Roomedit CouchDB, didn't change any code, all seems to work correctly, it's using the localhost. If I go to CouchDB and to Futon I see 'roomedit' but I cannot figure out how to see/get the Room Editor open.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Glad to hear of your interest.</p>
<p>Do you see the room editor in the couchdb management console?</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/_utils">http://localhost:5984/_utils</a></li></ul>

<p>Then the room editor should appear at</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html">http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html</a></li></ul>

<p>Dan: I see roomedit. The link you replied with does not work in any browser.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/roomedit_couchdb_01.jpg" alt="Roomedit" width="610">
</center></p>
<p>Jeremy: Oh dear, that is strange and unfortunate.</p>
<p>I see it at</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html">http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html</a></li></ul>

<p>Then, as I navigate through the project - level - room hierarchy, I move on to:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html?modelid=bf0552b6-b7f7-4331-96d5-b19843262895-00015084">http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html?modelid=bf0552b6-b7f7-4331-96d5-b19843262895-00015084</a></li></ul>

<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html?levelid=e3e052f9-0156-11d5-9301-0000863f27ad-00000137">http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html?levelid=e3e052f9-0156-11d5-9301-0000863f27ad-00000137</a></li></ul>

<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html?roomid=2c208b33-13f4-4e37-a4ba-2fe92782be83-00034629">http://localhost:5984/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html?roomid=2c208b33-13f4-4e37-a4ba-2fe92782be83-00034629</a></li></ul>

<p>I would have expected that it automatically work once you see it in the CouchDB utils console.</p>
<p>What do you see in the browser JavaScript debugging console?</p>
<p>Dan: I've attached all the images. Am I missing something? Thanks for the help and time.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/roomedit_couchdb_02.jpg" alt="Roomedit" width="595">
</center></p>
<p>Jeremy: How about this simpler URL?</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://localhost:5984/roomedit">http://localhost:5984/roomedit</a></li></ul>

<p>What does that return?</p>
<p>Look at my result below.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/roomedit_couchdb_03.jpg" alt="Roomedit" width="436">
</center></p>
<p>Dan: It returns this JSON:</p>
<pre>
{"db_name":"roomedit","doc_count":19,"doc_del_count":0,"update_seq":181,"purge_seq":0,"compact_running":false,"disk_size":401512,"data_size":15646,"instance_start_time":"1449760223302001","disk_format_version":6,"committed_update_seq":181}
</pre>

<p>Here is a screen snapshot:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/roomedit_couchdb_04.jpg" alt="Roomedit" width="503">
</center></p>
<p>Jeremy: That looks pretty good, actually. At least the database is there. On other hand, maybe it is something you set up yourself in a different manner, and maybe the appropriate design documents, such as index.html, are missing.</p>
<p>How did you set up the database, i.e., transfer the roomedit database definition from the files on the hard disk into CouchDB?</p>
<p>Dan: I honestly do not remember, guess I'm getting old :-(.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Jaime and I had quite a struggle doing so setting up the AEC booth at AU.</p>
<p>In the end, we copied a zip file of my existing database definition onto the new machine.</p>
<p>We could not get Kanso et al to work.</p>
<p>Dan: Is it possible to get your zipfile or would that not help?</p>
<p>Jeremy: Sure I can send you that. Here
is <a href="files/roomedit_couchdb.zip">roomedit_couchdb.zip</a> containing all you need.</p>
<p>I created it using this command line:</p>
<pre>
C:\>zip -r roomedit_couchdb "Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\CouchDB\var\lib\couchdb"
</pre>

<p>Note that it includes the full path, so unpack it carefully, e.g. in a temporary directory, then move the files to your couchdb installation.</p>
<p>Dan: Works fine with your db files, all I had to do is overwrite mine and all worked correctly. Iâ€™m pretty sure I followed your original instructions and the info on Couch website. You may want to post the files on your blog for others.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and all your help!</p>
